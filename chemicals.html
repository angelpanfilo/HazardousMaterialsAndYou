                                If you're exposed to chemicals at home, act quickly to minimize potential harm. Move to
                                a well-ventilated area and remove any contaminated clothing. Rinse skin or eyes with
                                water if they come into contact with the chemical. Seek medical attention immediately if
                                you experience any symptoms such as difficulty breathing, dizziness, or nausea.
                                Prevention is the best approach, so always read labels, follow instructions, and store
                                chemicals safely away from children and pets.

                                            headaches, or even more serious health problems.</li>
                                        <li>Fire Hazards: Certain cleaning products contain flammable ingredients, such
                                            as alcohol or solvents, that can easily ignite if they come into contact

                                    To mitigate the risk of harm from cleaning products, it is important to take several
                                    preventative measures. These measures include:
                                    <ul class="text-info">
                                        <br>

                                            product packaging.</li>
                                        <li class="text-dark">Storing cleaning products in a secure location, out of reach of children and
                                            pets, and away from heat sources.</li>
                                        <li>Wearing protective gear, such as gloves or goggles, when using certain
                                            cleaning products.
                                        </li>
                                        <li class="text-dark"> Keeping cleaning products away from food or food preparation areas.</li>

                                        <li>Avoiding mixing different cleaning products together, as this can create
                                            dangerous chemical reactions.</li>
                                        <li class="text-dark">Properly disposing of unused or expired cleaning products.</li>

                                    <p class="lead text-danger">Implementing these preventative measures can
                                        significantly decrease the likelihood of incidents related to cleaning product
                                        hazards, ultimately promoting the safety and wellbeing of both individuals and
                                        their families.</p>

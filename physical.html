                            Learning CPR is an essential skill that can be learned through classes and online resources.
                            The American Heart Association recommends that everyone should learn CPR, especially those
                            who are responsible for children, elderly individuals, or individuals with health
                            conditions. Proper CPR training can give you the knowledge and confidence to act quickly and
                            effectively in an emergency situation. In addition to CPR, it is also recommended to have an
                            automated external defibrillator (AED) available in public areas, as it can significantly
                            increase the chance of survival for someone experiencing cardiac arrest. With CPR training
                            and the availability of AEDs, individuals can be empowered to take action and potentially
                            save lives.

                                        <li>CPR can double or even triple a person's chances of survival after cardiac

                                    measures. These measures include installing a CO detector in the home, ensuring
                                    that
                                    all
                                    fuel-burning
                                    appliances
                                    are properly maintained and vented, and never running a car or other
                                    gasoline-powered engine
                                    in
                                    an
                                    enclosed
                                    space. In addition, it is important to
                                    recognize the signs and symptoms of CO poisoning, such as headaches, dizziness,
                                    nausea,
                                    confusion,
                                    and
                                    weakness,
                                    and seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms are present. By taking
                                    these steps,
                                    individuals can
                                    reduce the risk of CO poisoning and ensure the safety of themselves and their
                                    loved
                                    ones.
